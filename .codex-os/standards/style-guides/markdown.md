# Markdown Style Guide

- Use `#` heading hierarchy; avoid skipping levels.
- Wrap paragraphs at ~100 characters for readability.
- Prefer bullet lists for steps; numbered lists for ordered actions.
- Include code fences with language tags (` ```ts `, ` ```sol `, ` ```sh `).
- Reference files using relative paths (e.g., `apps/web/pages/earn.tsx`).
- Add tables for stack summaries or comparison matrices.
- Note timestamps in ISO format (`2025-10-17`).
