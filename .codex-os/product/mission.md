# Mission

AgenticYield delivers a self-custodial yield agent for USDC on Base that automatically allocates across protocols (Aave, Curve, Base native yield) using a Risk-Adjusted Yield Score (RAYS). The platform must remain:

- **Safe**: security-first SDLC, deterministic guards, explainable automation, and rapid kill switches.
- **Transparent**: every allocation decision includes human-readable proofs, charts, and receipts.
- **Composable**: Next.js dashboard, TypeScript worker, and Solidity vault contracts operate as modular components.
- **Spec-driven**: All work flows through Spec Kit specs and tasks; no feature ships without an approved spec and documented risk analysis.
