# Handoff â€” 2025-10-21

## Progress
- Ran mandated preflight checks: verified git repository state and confirmed tracked secret scan clean.
- Updated `Agents.md` Start Here pointer and persisted Memory MCP reference so takeover workflows stay aligned.

## Blockers
- None.

## Decisions
- Treated missing `CLAUDE.MD` as not yet provided; ready to adopt guidance once it appears.

## Current focus
- Repository remains clean and ready for incoming spec-driven implementation work.

## Next steps (24h)
- Execute next assigned spec tasks under security-first SDLC guardrails.
