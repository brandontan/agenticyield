# Handoff â€” 2025-10-21

## Progress
- Re-ran preflight checks (git status + tracked-secret scan) to confirm clean baseline.
- Updated `Agents.md` Start Here pointer and persisted Memory MCP reference so takeover workflows stay aligned.
- Executed TheAuditor `aud full`; audit completed with HIGH status calling out CSRF and XSS gaps in `apps/relayer/src/routes/relayer.ts`.

## Blockers
- None.

## Decisions
- Treated missing `CLAUDE.MD` as not yet provided; ready to adopt guidance once it appears.

## Current focus
- Repository remains clean; immediate priority is addressing TheAuditor high-severity findings in relayer routes.

## Next steps (24h)
- Draft mitigation plan for relayer CSRF/XSS findings and feed into next spec cycle.
- Execute next assigned spec tasks under security-first SDLC guardrails.
