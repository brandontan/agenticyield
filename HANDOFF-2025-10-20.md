# Handoff — 2025-10-20

## Progress
- Cleaned repository: unstaged all inherited changes, restored tracked files to `HEAD`, and removed 700+ untracked files/directories (vendorized OpenZeppelin tree, new packages, CI, etc.).
- Re-established takeover docs: refreshed `AGENTS.md` Start Here pointer to this handoff and recreated today’s summary from scratch.

## Blockers
- None after cleanup; workspace matches `origin/master`.

## Decisions
- Dropped prior uncommitted changes entirely to regain baseline; any needed pieces must be reintroduced through spec-driven work.

## Current focus
- Repository hygiene verified so future tasks can proceed from a clean slate.

## Next steps (24h)
- Recreate required features via scoped specs and commits now that tree is clean.
- Run Auditor baseline once new functionality starts landing to maintain security posture.
