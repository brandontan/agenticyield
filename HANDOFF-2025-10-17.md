# Handoff â€” 2025-10-17

## Progress
- RainbowKit provider rebuilt so WalletConnect is listed first, metadata follows the live hostname, and Coinbase connect now works without crashes.
- Wallet badge updated to fetch live Base USDC balances via wagmi when the wallet is on Base.
- Production redeployed to `v0-agentic-yield-ui.vercel.app/earn`; lint/typecheck/build all green before ship.

## Blockers
- WalletConnect still rejects sessions: cloud API returns `Unauthorized: invalid key` because the project ID in WalletConnect Cloud is failing (likely permissions/plan). Requires owner action.
- Auditor scan still pending for the new build.

## Decisions
- Kept mock totals elsewhere; only surface real USDC for the connected wallet to avoid misleading numbers.
- Metadata now derives from `window.location.origin` to keep deploy previews happy.

## Current focus
- Monitoring wallet UX parity on mobile vs desktop once WalletConnect issue is resolved.

## Next steps (24h)
- Generate a fresh WalletConnect Cloud project ID, update env (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_ID`) without whitespace, and redeploy.
- Run Auditor security scan on the new commit.
- If live balance display is desired elsewhere, reuse the new wagmi hook.
