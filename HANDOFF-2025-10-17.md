# Handoff â€” 2025-10-17

## What changed
- Takeover prep only: Start Here section restored in `AGENTS.md`.
- Memory MCP note updated for 2025-10-17 handoff.
- Handoff log refreshed with current status.

## Risks / mitigations
- Repo still missing baseline commit for tracked files; expect large diff until history rebuilt.
- Auditor and Spec Kit runs not executed today; pending after repo bootstrap.

## Next steps (24h)
- Stage repo baseline, align with Spec Kit tasks, and set up Auditor scan.
- Confirm product docs in `.codex-os/product/` match new scope.
- Verify mock APIs and Supabase schema before enabling runner integration.
