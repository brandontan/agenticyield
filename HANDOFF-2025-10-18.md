# Handoff â€” 2025-10-18

## Progress
- Spec `2025-10-18-walletconnect-remediation` published (SRD, tech spec, tasks) and roadmap linked.
- WalletConnect env loader added; revoked fallback removed from `Web3Providers`.
- `.env.example` and README now describe WalletConnect Cloud setup.
- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` passed with synthetic WalletConnect project ID; `pnpm test` exits (no suites defined).

## Blockers
- Memory MCP write path unavailable; pointer still manual.
- WalletConnect pairing not retested end-to-end because no valid project ID available during takeover.

## Decisions
- Builds now fail fast when `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_ID` missing or malformed to prevent shipping revoked IDs.
- Hold Auditor scan until a fresh WalletConnect key is configured and deploy is ready.

## Current focus
- Ensure operators provision the new WalletConnect environment variable before redeploying.

## Next steps (24h)
- Provision/verify a real WalletConnect Cloud project ID, update Vercel env, and rerun QR pairing.
- Run Auditor security scan after redeploy.
- Backfill MCP persistence once service becomes accessible.
