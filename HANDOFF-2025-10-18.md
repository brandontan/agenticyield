# Handoff â€” 2025-10-18

## Progress
- Verified takeover preflight items: repo state clean, tracked-secret scan quiet, Start Here confirmed.
- Logged Memory MCP pointer confirmation via MCP API and echoed takeover validation messages.
- Synced Supabase credentials locally and through Vercel environment management so deployments share the same config.

## Blockers
- `claude.md` still absent even though takeover workflow expects it.
- Auditor + Spec Kit runs deferred until spec ownership clarified; no active ticket to justify execution.

## Decisions
- Retained existing Start Here copy; no conflicting guidance detected.
- Captured Supabase env alignment as the only operational change for this shift.

## Current focus
- Maintain takeover readiness documentation and ensure env secrets remain synchronized.

## Next steps (24h)
- Author or restore `claude.md` so future agents can comply with takeover instructions.
- Confirm whether Auditor baseline scan is required post-secret rotation.
- Revisit spec backlog for relayer/WalletConnect once product owner provides direction.
