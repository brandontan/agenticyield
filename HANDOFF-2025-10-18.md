# Handoff — 2025-10-18

## Progress
- Preflight checks completed: repo clean, tracked-secret scan quiet.
- `AGENTS.md` Start Here now points at today’s log and Memory MCP reference pinned.
- New daily handoff prepared with priorities and context.

## Blockers
- Memory MCP write path unavailable; manual pointer retained for now.

## Decisions
- Keep security checklist cadence: run Auditor post-deploy per takeover guidance.

## Current focus
- Maintain documentation accuracy and security posture for the handoff.

## Next steps (24h)
- Confirm Auditor tooling path and schedule next scan run after code changes.
- Sync WalletConnect credentials once owner resolves invalid key.
- Backfill MCP persistence once service becomes accessible.
