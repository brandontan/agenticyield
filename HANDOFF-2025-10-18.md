# Handoff — 2025-10-18

## Progress
- Ran takeover preflight checks: git repo validated, clean state confirmed, no tracked secret-pattern filenames.
- Confirmed `AGENTS.md` Start Here guidance still points to today’s handoff and memory pointer.
- Persisted Memory MCP pointer under AgenticYield entity via MCP tooling request.

## Blockers
- `CLAUDE.MD` missing from repo; takeover instructions say to read it first.
- Memory MCP add endpoint flaky—initial add failed before entity creation retry.
- WalletConnect live pairing still unverified due to lack of project ID; relayer sponsorship + Supabase schema work pending.

## Decisions
- Left Start Here bullets unchanged to keep prior operator guidance intact during takeover.
- Holding Auditor scan until WalletConnect credentials exist and deploy queue resumes.

## Current focus
- Keep operational docs aligned for takeover handoff while awaiting WalletConnect credentials and relayer work.

## Next steps (24h)
- Restore `CLAUDE.MD` so future operators stay compliant.
- Pick up relayer policy + Supabase schema tasks from spec once credentials ready.
- Obtain WalletConnect Cloud project ID, update envs, rerun pairing, then schedule Auditor scan.
- Re-run MCP persistence once endpoint reliability improves.
